      "full": "A doppelgänger (German for \\\"double-goer\\\" or \\\"double-walker\\\") is the apparitional double or duplicate of a living person. The phenomenon manifests in several forms: individuals seeing their own double (autoscopy), others witnessing someone in two places simultaneously (bilocation), or crisis apparitions where doubles appear at moments of danger or death. Historically considered an omen of death or bad luck in European folklore, the doppelgänger phenomenon spans cultures worldwide and has been documented throughout history. Famous cases include German writer Goethe meeting himself on a road, Abraham Lincoln's eerie double reflection in 1860, and the extensively documented case of French teacher Emilie Sagée (1845-46), whose double was witnessed by over 40 students and staff. Modern science recognizes some doppelgänger experiences as neurological conditions (autoscopy, heautoscopy) caused by dysfunction in the brain's temporoparietal junction, while other cases remain unexplained, bridging paranormal, psychological, and potentially quantum phenomena."
