      "summary": "The duplicate or double of a living person, appearing as an exact replica. May be seen by the person themselves or by others, often considered an omen of death or misfortune in traditional folklore.",
      "full": "A doppelgänger (German for 'double-goer' or 'double-walker') is the apparitional double or duplicate of a living person. The phenomenon manifests in several forms: individuals seeing their own double (autoscopy), others witnessing someone in two places simultaneously (bilocation), or crisis apparitions where doubles appear at moments of danger or death. Historically considered an omen of death or bad luck, the doppelgänger phenomenon spans cultures worldwide and has been documented throughout history, from ancient folklore to modern neurological case studies. Famous historical cases include Goethe meeting himself on a road, Abraham Lincoln's double reflection, and the extensively documented case of teacher Emilie Sagée (1845-46). Modern science recognizes some doppelgänger experiences as neurological conditions (autoscopy, heautoscopy) while others remain unexplained, bridging paranormal, psychological, and potentially quantum phenomena."
